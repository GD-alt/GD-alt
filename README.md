# GD-alt

Hi, my name is Dan and this is my personal GitHub page. I am a software developer and some usual Russian guy from St. Petersburg. I am interested in programming, producing half-baked useless apps, language learning (especially German, English sux), playing DRG with these two guys: [G82ft](https://github.com/G82ft) and [ETO-YTKA](https://github.com/ETO-YTKA), trying to spare some time to play guitar and other stuff. Sometimes I do translate things. I'm also a huge fun of using AI in solving boring tasks and automation in general.

## Projects

- **[ospa](https://github.com/GD-alt/ospa)** (*Python*) — a simple server for quick… uhm… serving of HTML and PHP files. Usable for testing purposes.
- **[mathtaker](https://github.com/GD-alt/ospa)** (*Dart*) — a simple math quiz app. Raw and unpolished, but usable (sorry, it won't change).
- **[turinger](https://github.com/GD-alt/turinger)** (*Rust*) — your Turing machine is a programming language now. I could just parse a string,  but I decided to go with PEG grammars. It's fun.
- **[bookshop](https://github.com/GD-alt/bookshop)** (*PHP*) — I hate PHP, but still, I had to use it for my college project. It's a simple bookshop with a database.
- **[libsim](https://github.com/GD-alt/libsim)** (*C#*) — college project again. It's like a toolkit for working with presumable library's database, but there's no database backend and frontend is in WinForms. Mess.
- **[introdoc](https://github.com/GD-alt/introdoc)** (*Python*) — automating boring stuff! Especially, this thing creates Word **doc**uments from **intro**spected MSSQL servers.
-  **[irgendetwas](https://github.com/GD-alt/irgendetwas)** (*Python*) — some AI stuff, yeah! It uses Google's Gemini API to generate site content based on the provided URL. Fun.
